/*
	Script Name:       FixUnsortedNames
	Script Purpose:    Fixes some of the Unsorted new filenames to be in proper order.
	Script Maintainer: SuperSaiyajinStackZ
	Last Updated:      05. September 2022
	Version:           0.1
	Additional Notes:
					   Because i usually just go with a name like "code1_1.s" etc when i separate things, i use this script to
					   convert them into "code<Num>.s" etc instead.

					   The files get placed at the unsorted directory of the script directory,
					   so i can just replace them with the old ones.

					   THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THE LINKERSCRIPT THOUGH, THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE MANUALLY.
