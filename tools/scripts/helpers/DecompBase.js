	So we won't have to re-define them everywhere else, and just here for all the main scripts.

	baserom:   The path to the base ROM.
	gamecode:  The game code from offset ACh (4 ASCII Characters).
	makercode: The maker code from offset B0h (2 ASCII Characters).
	resultrom: The path to the resulted ROM.
	title:     The title from offset A0h (12 ASCII Characters max).
	version:   The Software version from offset BCh (Usually 0).

	The paths need to be based of the tools/scripts directory, because the main scripts are called from there.
